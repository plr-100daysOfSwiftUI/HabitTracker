# HabitTracker
[100 Days of SwiftUI - Day 47: Challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/4/3/challenge)

A habit-tracking app, for folks who want to keep track of how much they do certain things.

1. there should be a list of all activities they want to track, plus a form to add new activities â€“ a title and description should be enough.
2. Tapping one of the activities should show a detail screen with the description, how many times they have completed it, plus a button incrementing their completion count.
3. use Codable and UserDefaults to load and save all your data.
